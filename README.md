# HAADF-STEM Hackathon: Defect Classification in 2D Materials

## Note to Hackathon organizers: The code for our analysis and figures is in the notebooks folder. The atom_gui.py script can be run to test the deep learning pipeline on the included dm3 file.

## Motivation

This project addresses the challenge of defect classification for 2D material STEM datasets. Identifying and classifying defects in scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) images is crucial for understanding material properties and improving manufacturing processes. By developing automated machine learning solutions, we can accelerate the analysis of these complex datasets and provide more consistent, reliable defect characterization.

## Problem Definition

This project focuses on identifying defects in an open-source HAADF-STEM (High-Angle Annular Dark-Field Scanning Transmission Electron Microscopy) dataset from Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL). The dataset contains STEM images of MoWSSe (Molybdenum-Tungsten-Sulfur-Selenium) 2D materials, which may exhibit various structural defects that affect their properties.

## Dataset

A relevant dataset is publicly available from ORNL, containing STEM images of MoWSSe materials:

- **Dataset Link**: [ORNL Dataset](https://doi.ccs.ornl.gov/dataset/78833284-28a4-59da-9790-3624a6f8b9e3)
- **Content**: HAADF-STEM images of MoWSSe 2D materials
- **Format**: Includes data and accompanying Jupyter notebook

## Target

The primary goal of this hackathon project is to **develop machine learning models to identify and classify defects reliably in STEM images**. This includes:

- Detection of various defect types in the 2D material structure
- Classification of identified defects
- Development of robust, reproducible ML pipelines
- Evaluation of model performance on the dataset
